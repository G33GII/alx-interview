# 2D Matrix Rotation

This project provides a Python script that rotates a given n x n 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise. 

## Overview

The rotation is done in-place, meaning the original matrix is modified directly without the need for additional storage. This is particularly useful for reducing memory usage when dealing with large matrices.
