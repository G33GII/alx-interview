# 0x02. Minimum Operations

## Project Overview

This project aims to determine the minimum number of operations needed to achieve exactly `n` `H` characters in a file, starting with one `H` and using only two operations: Copy All and Paste.

## Learning Objectives

- Optimize solutions to minimize operations.
- Develop skills in algorithm design.

## Problem Description

Given a number `n`, write a method `minOperations(n)` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` `H` characters.
